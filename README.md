## How to Set as Your Browser Start Page
You can use two methods to make this your homepage:

1. Using Local File Path
Set the local index.html file as your homepage:

Find your index.html file on your computer.

Example file URL format:
file:///Users/yourusername/Documents/Solor/index.html (Mac)
file:///C:/Users/yourusername/Documents/Solor/index.html (Windows)

Follow the browser-specific steps above (see “How to Set as Your Browser Start Page” section).

2. Using Live URL
Simply use this deployed link (works from anywhere!):
